## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- **Tokenization**  
  Split raw text into words, sentences, or subwords for further analysis.

- **Stopword Removal**  
  Eliminate common words to reduce noise and improve model performance.

- **Stemming & Lemmatization**  
  Standardize words to their root or dictionary form for consistent feature extraction.

- **Vectorization**  
  Convert text into numerical features using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and more.
